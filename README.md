# Land of Vines – Visual Effects & Shader Showcase (Godot)

Land of Vines is a small 2D platformer created to showcase visual effects, custom shaders, and engine-driven animations in Godot.  
The project focuses on improving the visual quality of games built with free or low-cost assets through technical art solutions.

## Project Context

This project was developed as part of my master’s thesis:
**“Methods of Creating and Applying Visual Effects in Video Games”**

The main goal was to explore how custom shaders, visual effects, and engine-side animations can significantly enhance atmosphere, readability, and visual fidelity without relying on expensive assets.

## What My Project Demonstrates

- Custom 2D shaders
- Visual effects improving depth and atmosphere
- Procedural and tween-based animations
- Shader-based techniques for lighting and environmental effects
- Improving visual quality using only free assets as a base
